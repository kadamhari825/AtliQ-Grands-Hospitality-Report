# AtliQ-Grands-Hospitality-Report
In this project I have worked on Hospitality domain project. The main aim of this project was to provide insights to AtliQ Grands a hotel chain which is loosing market share and revenue

## Project Context:
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.
Task :
You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task. You can download all relevant documents from the download section.
1.	Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2.	Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3.	Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

## Work outline :
Loaded data and made various connections in data model.
Created calculated column in Dim_date Table. along with that created measures like revenue, average rating, ADR, RevPAR, DBRN, DSRN for various KPIs that we needed.
Created visuals for insight generation and formulated dashboard outline.
Summarized the findings and suggested the key measures that could increase business outlook.

## Insights :
1. 40% of our revenue comes from Mumbai city where as Delhi’s contribution is least amounting to 7 % only.
2. Elite room class is preferred more by customers and so does it adding highest to our revenue pool. Along with that Standard room class is doing poorly in terms of revenue generation and its RevPAR which is least among 4.
3. revenue on weekends could increase provided we could lower the prices because we are having same % occupancy on weekdays and weekends. To support that we have lower ADR on weekdays, which might be a reason for higher bookings.
4. AtliQ seasons property is adding least revenue to our books. We need to take a look at customers review because seasons rating is abysmal of 2.2 and lowest occupancy % among all so that decision could be taken whether we need upskilling of staff .
5. Since week 27 we are witnessing less cancellation % which is good sign as our business is concerned.
6. Others, Makemytrip and logtrip are the platforms through which we had highest bookings amounting to 40%, 20% and 11 % of all respectively.
7.  From the ratings charts it is evident that Delhi’s properties have highest rating and occupancy % , which contradicts the % revenue brought by it. It means that increasing capacity and reducing the cancellation rate could be game changer for us.
